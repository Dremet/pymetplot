# pymetplot
Will let you easily plot meteorological grid-based data from the GFS model with python.

Currently there is already a working version that I use on http://wetterquelle.de/models for plotting. Reasons to work on this repo anyways: First, I am not totally satisfied with the way the current version is coded, and second, I want to make it available to others. Let me know if you want to help.
